# How-Did-I-Track?
How-Did-I-Track? is a webapp that was designed to facilitate the sensemaking of long-term physical activity data to support reflection. The webapp was built using the Dash framework.

This repository contains the source code for How-Did-I-Track? which was created for my 2023 honours thesis. 

## To Run
How-Did-I-Track? requires the packages: `dash`, `dash_bootstrap_components`, `dash_mantine_components`, `pandas`, and `plotly_calplot` to run.

All packages can be installed by running `sh install_packages.sh` or individually using `pip3`.

Enter `python3 app.py` into the command line and open the URL that is printed in the terminal.
