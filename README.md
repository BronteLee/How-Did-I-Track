# How-Did-I-Track?
How-Did-I-Track? is a webapp that was designed to facilitate the sensemaking of long-term physical activity data to support reflection. The webapp was built using the Dash framework.

This repository contains the source code for How-Did-I-Track? which was created for my 2023 honours thesis.
